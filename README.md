ChatBot with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Multimodal Expansion
This repository contains the implementation of a chatbot powered by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). The chatbot is designed to enhance conversations by retrieving relevant information from external sources, allowing for more informed responses. In future updates, the chatbot will be extended with multimodal capabilities, including handling both text and image inputs.

Features
RAG-based architecture: Leverages external knowledge to generate more accurate and context-aware responses.
Efficient retrieval mechanism: Integrates a retriever for fetching relevant documents or data.
Multimodal expansion (Coming Soon): Support for images, audio, and video inputs, allowing the chatbot to process and respond to various media types.
Scalable design: Modular structure to allow easy upgrades and extensions.
Installation
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/chatbot-rag.git
cd chatbot-rag

Install dependencies: Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed. Then run:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Set up external knowledge sources:

You can configure different document sources or APIs that the chatbot will use for retrieval.
Add the sources in the config.json file.
Usage
Run the chatbot locally:
python app.py

Future Updates
Multimodal capabilities: Plans to support image, video, and audio input processing.
Improved retrieval mechanisms: More efficient integration with larger external data sources.
Cloud deployment: Ready-to-deploy configurations for cloud platforms.
